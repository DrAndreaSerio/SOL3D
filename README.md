# [SOL3D](https://github.com/SerioLab/SOL3D/edit/main/README.md#sol3d)

### *A public resource and design repository from the Serio Lab for microfabrication processes in biology using 3D printing.

This repository is linked to our publication detailing a complete, easy to implement, low-cost & high-resolution microfabrication pipeline, which can be used by any wet lab or research team to create customised devices for cell culture and other experiments.

You can read the pre-print detailing our study here:

[https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.02.22.481424v4.full](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.02.22.481424v4.full)

We provide here all the CAD design files, in either .stl or .f3d format, to enable any interested party to recreate the devices we describe in out paper. For details of which files correspond to specific figures within our paper, see the **Legend** (https://github.com/SerioLab/SOL3D/blob/main/Legend.xlsx).

To help users getting started we also have written a step by step ''How to Guide'' , which contain useful info on printing technology, consideration with design and resin selection, principles of CAD and useful info for customizing the designs, as well as tips on how to optimize the printing and post processing pipeline.  You can find the guide here: https://github.com/SerioLab/SOL3D/blob/main/Sol3D-PLOS%20BIO%20Supplementary%20Guide.pdf


Our work is currently under review for publication within a journal and we will update this page with the info once it is had been accepted.
